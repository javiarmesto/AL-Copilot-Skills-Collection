## Quick Start

1. **Install** the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FernandoArtigasAlfonso.al-copilot-skills-collection).
2. **Open** any AL project in VS Code.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and run **"AL Copilot Skills Collection: Install Skills"**.
4. Skills are deployed to `.github/skills/` and instructions to `.github/instructions/` in your workspace.
5. **Start using Copilot** — skills are automatically picked up when the task matches.

---

## Features

### One-Command Skill Installation

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run:

- **AL Copilot Skills Collection: Install Skills** — Installs all bundled skills and instructions to your workspace.
- **AL Copilot Skills Collection: Update Skills** — Updates existing skills to the latest version (with confirmation prompt).

The extension automatically:
- Creates the `.github/skills/` and `.github/instructions/` folder structure
- Copies all skill packages with their references and examples
- Shows progress notifications during installation
- Reports exactly how many skills and instruction files were deployed

### Bundled Skills

Each skill is a self-contained package of instructions, references, and templates that turns GitHub Copilot into a **specialized AL development assistant**.

| `skill-contribution-assistant` | Guides contributors to design, polish, and submit high-quality skills to the collection |

### Agent-Agnostic Skills

Skills follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard — a portable format adopted by multiple agent products (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Roo Code, and others). The extension deploys them to `.github/skills/` by default, but you can copy them to your agent's preferred location.

---

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code** 1.85.0 or higher
- **AL Language Extension** for Business Central development
- **GitHub Copilot** (or any agent supporting the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard)

---

## How It Works

When you run **"AL Copilot Skills Collection: Install Skills"**, the extension:

1. Detects your workspace root folder.
2. Creates `.github/skills/` and `.github/instructions/` if they don't exist.
3. Copies all bundled skill packages (SKILL.md, references, examples) into your workspace.
4. GitHub Copilot automatically discovers and loads skills when you ask it to perform a matching task.

Each skill folder follows this structure:

```text
.github/skills/
└── bc-api-page-generator/
    ├── SKILL.md              ← Main instructions (loaded by the agent)
    ├── AUTHORS.md            ← Author and co-author information
    ├── CHANGELOG.md          ← Version history
    └── references/           ← Supporting files, examples, templates
```

## Extension Settings

This extension does not add any VS Code settings. It activates automatically when an AL file is detected in the workspace.
